"""
WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

This program prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.

ex:
HELLO, WORLD!
hello, world!

text = input("Enter Text: ")
lowered = text.lower()
